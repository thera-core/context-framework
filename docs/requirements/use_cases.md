## Context-Framework: Use Cases

Below are representative scenarios where the **context-framework** is utilized to attach and manage metadata. These use cases assume the existence of an in-memory or external context store and one or more `ContextAwareDataStructure` adapters.

---

### Use Case 1: Storing Column-Level Metadata

**Primary Actor:** Data Scientist using Pandas  
**Goal:** Attach metadata to a specific column of a DataFrame describing transformation provenance.  

1. A user imports the `context-framework` and a `PandasContextAdapter`.  
2. The user creates or loads a Pandas DataFrame.  
3. The user wraps the DataFrame with `PandasContextAdapter(my_dataframe)`.  
4. The user calls `adapter.add_context(('column', 'GeneSymbol'), {'source': 'PubMed', 'operation': 'normalize'})`.  
5. Later, the user retrieves the context via `adapter.get_context(('column', 'GeneSymbol'))` to see the provenance metadata.

**Success Condition:** The system stores and retrieves the column-level context without interfering with the normal DataFrame operations.  
**Failure Condition:** The system fails to store the metadata or raises an error due to missing column references.

### Use Case 2: Retrieving Metadata for Audit / Logging

**Primary Actor:** Multi-agent Orchestrator (e.g., TheraLab)  
**Goal:** Retrieve the transformation history of a dataset for logging or display in a Digital Journal.  

1. The orchestrator triggers a series of data augmentation tasks (e.g., normalizing multiple columns).  
2. Each augmentation step calls `adapter.add_context(...)` with the transformation name, timestamp, and parameters used.  
3. At the end of the workflow, the orchestrator queries `adapter.list_context_keys()` or iterates through known data elements to compile a transformation log.  
4. The orchestrator sends the compiled context logs to a Digital Journal or displays them to the user.

**Success Condition:** The orchestrator obtains a comprehensive list of transformations from the stored metadata.  
**Failure Condition:** The context store is empty or partial due to incorrect usage or store errors.

### Use Case 3: Switching to an External Context Store

**Primary Actor:** DevOps engineer deploying a large-scale system  
**Goal:** Replace the default in-memory store with a Redis-backed context store for better performance and multi-instance usage.  

1. The engineer installs a Redis-based store (e.g., `RedisContextStore`) from an extension or plugin in the same library (or from a separate package).  
2. The engineer modifies the `ContextAwareDataStructure` initialization to accept a `RedisContextStore` instead of the default `InMemoryContextStore`.  
3. The existing usage code (e.g., `adapter.add_context(key, value)`) remains the same.  
4. The engineer verifies that context reads/writes now go to Redis.

**Success Condition:** Context data is persisted/retrieved via Redis without changes to the higher-level logic.  
**Failure Condition:** Redis connection issues or store exceptions prevent context from being saved.

### Use Case 4: Custom Adapter for a Domain-Specific Data Structure

**Primary Actor:** Library Developer  
**Goal:** Integrate the `context-framework` with a domain-specific data structure (e.g., a custom object storing genomic data).  

1. The developer creates a new class `GenomicContextAdapter` implementing `ContextAwareDataStructure`.  
2. The class implements methods for setting and retrieving metadata relevant to genomic features, such as `(“chromosome”, “position”)`.  
3. The developer writes unit tests to ensure `get_context`, `add_context`, `remove_context`, and `list_context_keys` all behave as expected.  
4. The developer publishes or documents `GenomicContextAdapter` for usage in specialized HPC pipelines.

**Success Condition:** Domain-specific data structures gain the ability to store context without rewriting or duplicating the core context logic.  
**Failure Condition:** The new adapter fails to handle data mapping correctly, leading to ambiguous or lost metadata.

### Use Case 5: Adding / Removing Context in an Interactive Session

**Primary Actor:** Data Engineer / Interactive Developer  
**Goal:** Dynamically add or remove context tags on-the-fly while iterating on a dataset.  

1. The user starts a Python interactive session (e.g., a Jupyter notebook).  
2. They create an `adapter = PandasContextAdapter(df, context_store=InMemoryContextStore())`.  
3. They perform some transformations on `df`, each time calling `adapter.add_context(...)` with the transformation details.  
4. Upon realizing a mistake, they remove the incorrect metadata with `adapter.remove_context(key)`.  
5. They continue to add corrected context and verify it with `adapter.get_context(...)`.

**Success Condition:** The user can iteratively manage metadata as the dataset evolves, without confusion.  
**Failure Condition:** Removing context fails or leaves stale metadata references.

---

These use cases demonstrate **typical** interactions with the `context-framework` in real-world scenarios. They also highlight the **flexibility** and **extensibility** of the library, ensuring it can be adopted in various contexts (data science, HPC, custom domains, etc.).
