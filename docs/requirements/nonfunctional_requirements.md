## Context-Framework: Nonfunctional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - **REQ-NF01**: The library **should** introduce minimal overhead in storing and retrieving context, especially for large data.  
   - **REQ-NF02**: When used in a multi-threaded or multi-process environment, context access **should** be thread-safe if an external store is used (e.g., Redis).

2. **Scalability**
   - **REQ-NF03**: The design **must** allow for future scaling, such as replacing the in-memory store with a distributed store without major refactoring.  
   - **REQ-NF04**: Storing metadata for large datasets (e.g., tens of millions of rows) **should** remain feasible, though advanced indexing or summarization may be required externally.

3. **Maintainability**
   - **REQ-NF05**: The codebase **must** be well-structured, modular, and easy to navigate, adhering to standard Python packaging and naming conventions.  
   - **REQ-NF06**: All public interfaces **should** be documented with docstrings and type hints to ease comprehension and reduce maintenance burden.

4. **Reliability**
   - **REQ-NF07**: The framework **must** handle partial failures gracefully. If a context store call fails, the user **must** receive a clear error message or exception.  
   - **REQ-NF08**: The framework **should** offer transaction-like behavior if required by external store integrations (atomic context updates).

5. **Testability**
   - **REQ-NF09**: The framework **must** include a comprehensive test suite (unit tests, integration tests where relevant) that ensures correctness of context operations.  
   - **REQ-NF10**: Tests **should** cover edge cases like empty datasets, missing context keys, concurrent writes (if implemented), etc.

6. **Usability**
   - **REQ-NF11**: The API **should** be intuitive for developers adding context to new or existing data structures.  
   - **REQ-NF12**: Documentation **must** provide examples of typical usage patterns and advanced usage (e.g., custom adapters).

7. **Security**
   - **REQ-NF13**: If extended to external or distributed context stores, the framework **should** avoid storing sensitive user data in plain text unless encryption or secure storage is configured.
