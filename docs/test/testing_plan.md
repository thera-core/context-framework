## 1. Introduction

The **Context-Tracking Framework** is central to multi-repo projects, providing metadata management for data structures in both local and distributed environments. This document details the **testing strategy** to verify correctness, performance, and reliability. It aims to ensure:

- **High code quality** (fewer regressions, consistent behavior)  
- **Confidence** in changes and new features  
- **Maintainability** and **scalability** as the project evolves

---

## 2. Scope & Objectives

1. **Core APIs**: Verify the `ContextAwareDataStructure` interface and **Context Store** backends (in-memory, Redis, DB, etc.).  
2. **Adapter Implementations**: Ensure Pandas, Spark, or domain-specific adapters conform to expected behaviors (key validation, storing/retrieving context).  
3. **Integration**: Confirm interactions between adapters, stores, and external libraries.  
4. **Performance**: Validate that adding/retrieving context remains performant under typical or extreme loads (e.g., HPC, multi-node scenarios).  
5. **Security & Reliability**: Check for potential data corruption, concurrency issues, or insecure configurations.

---

## 3. Test Types & Approaches

### 3.1. Unit Testing

**Goal**: Test individual modules, classes, or functions in isolation.

- **Examples**:
  - `test_in_memory_store.py`: Verifies `InMemoryContextStore` CRUD operations.  
  - `test_context_aware_interface.py`: Ensures a mock adapter implements `add_context`, `get_context`, etc.  
  - `test_exceptions.py`: Confirms that `ContextKeyError` or `ContextStoreError` are raised in appropriate scenarios.

**Tools**:  
- **`pytest`** (preferred for Python)  
- **`unittest`** (alternative if needed)

**Characteristics**:
- Run **fast** and **often**.  
- Mocks or stubs are used to isolate dependencies.

### 3.2. Integration Testing

**Goal**: Verify that components work together as expected (e.g., an adapter using a specific store backend).

- **Examples**:
  - `test_pandas_adapter_with_inmemory.py`: Creates a Pandas adapter with the in-memory store and tests adding/retrieving row/column context.  
  - `test_pandas_adapter_with_redis.py`: Confirms that using a Redis backend works for concurrency or persistent context.  
  - **Spark Adapter**: Test storing partition-level metadata in a multi-threaded or local cluster Spark environment.

**Tools**:  
- Still use `pytest`, but with **real** instances of the store (e.g., Redis test container).  
- Potential usage of **Docker** or in-memory versions of DB/Redis for ephemeral integration tests.

### 3.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

**Goal**: Validate real-world user flows, such as:

1. **User** creates or loads data (Pandas DataFrame, Spark DF).  
2. Wraps the data in a **Context-Aware Adapter**.  
3. **Performs** transformations or calls `add_context`.  
4. **Exports** or inspects the final metadata (using `list_context_keys` or logs).

**Approach**:  
- Write **scenario-based tests** that replicate user actions.  
- Possibly coordinate with **TheraLab** (the orchestrator) if cross-repo E2E tests are desired.

### 3.4. Performance & Stress Testing

**Goal**: Confirm the framework’s **scalability** and **latency** under large volumes of context additions or retrievals, or distributed HPC setups.

- **Examples**:
  - `test_store_performance.py`: Times repeated `add_context` calls (10K+).  
  - HPC or Spark job that runs multiple partitions in parallel to measure throughput.

**Tools**:  
- **`pytest-benchmark`**, **custom scripts** using `time` or `timeit`.  
- **Load Testing** frameworks for distributed scenarios (e.g., custom HPC scripts or Spark job metrics).

### 3.5. Security & Reliability Checks

**Security** is limited in scope for a local library, but we still check:

- **No** plain-text leaks of sensitive data (keys, secrets) in logs.  
- **Graceful handling** of store failures or concurrency conflicts.  
- **Thread/Process Safety**: Ensure no data corruption if multiple processes write keys concurrently (particularly for Redis or DB backends).

---

## 4. Test Environment & Setup

1. **Local Environment**:  
   - Python 3.8+  
   - `pytest` or `unittest`  
   - Optional local Redis/DB for integration tests
2. **CI Environment**:  
   - GitHub Actions or similar.  
   - Use a Docker-based service for Redis/DB.  
   - Automated triggers for pull requests and merges.

3. **HPC / Spark** (optional advanced testing):  
   - Access to a cluster or local Spark installation.  
   - Scripts that create Spark sessions, run parallel tasks with the adapter, measure success and performance.

---

## 5. Test Coverage & Metrics

**Coverage Goals**:
- **Unit Coverage**: ≥ 80% lines/branches for core modules (`context_store.py`, `context_aware_data_structure.py`).  
- **Integration Coverage**: At least one test scenario for each store backend + adapter combination.  
- **Critical Path**: 100% coverage on error handling logic (exceptions, concurrency).

Use **coverage.py** (or built-in `pytest-cov`) to generate reports. Post them as part of CI to ensure coverage does not regress over time.

---

## 6. Test Workflow & Automation

**Recommended Flow**:
1. **Developer** branches from main, writes code + unit tests.  
2. **Pull Request** triggers **CI pipeline**:  
   - **Linting & Style Checks** (flake8, black).  
   - **Unit Tests** with coverage.  
   - **Integration Tests** (spinning up containers if needed).  
   - **Coverage Report** posted to PR.  
3. **Review & Merge**:  
   - If all checks pass, the PR is approved and merged.  
4. **Periodic** performance tests (nightly or on major merges).  

---

## 7. Roles & Responsibilities

1. **Core Maintainers**:  
   - Implement, review, and maintain the test suite.  
   - Ensure coverage metrics remain stable.  
2. **Contributors**:  
   - Add or update tests for new features or bug fixes.  
   - Follow coding standards and testing guidelines.  
3. **CI / DevOps**:  
   - Maintain the pipeline configuration (Docker images, environment variables).  
   - Oversee test environment updates (e.g., Redis or DB versions).

---

## 8. Risk & Mitigation Strategy

1. **Insufficient Coverage**:  
   - **Mitigation**: Enforce coverage thresholds in CI.  
2. **Brittle Tests**:  
   - **Mitigation**: Favor stable fixtures, mock external dependencies when possible, update tests as code evolves.  
3. **Long Test Times**:  
   - **Mitigation**: Separate unit tests (fast) from heavier integration or performance tests (can be run less frequently or in parallel).  
4. **Concurrency / Race Conditions**:  
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough integration tests with concurrency. Possibly use specialized concurrency testing frameworks or advanced test harnesses.

---

## 9. Versioning & Release Criteria

- **Semantic Versioning** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).  
- **Release Criteria**:  
  1. All **unit** and **integration** tests pass with **no** critical or high-severity issues.  
  2. Coverage remains above the **threshold**.  
  3. **Performance** checks show **no** major regressions (above agreed-upon latency thresholds).  
  4. If new store backends or adapters are introduced, they must include **integration tests** and **documentation**.

---

## 10. Conclusion & Future Steps

Following this **Testing & QA Plan** ensures that each **Context-Tracking Framework** component is thoroughly verified, from basic units to end-to-end workflows. Over time, we can **expand** coverage:

- Add **fuzz testing** for invalid keys or corrupted data.  
- Perform **static analysis** or **security scanning** if the code integrates with sensitive data.  
- Maintain HPC integration tests as usage scales up.

By regularly **reviewing** and **updating** this plan, we maintain a **robust** test strategy that keeps pace with **feature growth** and **evolving** user requirements.
